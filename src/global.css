/* This file is a hack because @property properties don't work inside an adopted
  stylesheet. See https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/15799#issuecomment-2614123880
  for validation.
  This file imports the tailwindcss utilities.css file and applies it to the
  global scope so we can bring some of those @property properties back.
